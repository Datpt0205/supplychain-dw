"""Identity bootstrap: verified token -> platform user + workspace memberships.

Used by ``GET /api/v1/auth/bootstrap`` before a workspace is selected. Unlike
``AccessContext`` building (which needs a tenant/workspace), bootstrap answers
"who am I and which workspaces can I enter?".

First-login provisioning: a brand-new verified identity — e.g. a user
who just self-registered in Keycloak — is added to the default demo tenant as a
plain ``member``. Existing/seeded users keep whatever memberships they already
have; they are never re-provisioned.
